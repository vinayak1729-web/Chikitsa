            "wellness_report": "Hey there! \ud83d\udc4b  Thanks for sharing your answers with me.  It takes courage to look at these things, and you've done great!  Let's chat about what your answers suggest, okay?  Think of me as your friendly guide in all this. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nSo, looking at your answers, it seems like you're someone who's got a good foundation.  It's awesome that you feel you have a strong support system \u2013 that's like having a superpower in life!  And really good news that you're not having thoughts of harming yourself or struggling with flashbacks.  That shows a good level of stability, which is fantastic! \ud83d\udc4d\n\nNow, let's just gently touch on a couple of things, okay?  You mentioned substance use.  It's super common, and lots of people use substances for different reasons.  Maybe it would be helpful to think a little bit about how it's fitting into your life, and if it's helping you feel the way you want to feel.  No judgment at all here, just something to maybe reflect on. \ud83e\udd14\n\nAlso, you said expressing feelings openly is a bit of a challenge right now.  Hey, emotions can be tricky for everyone!  Sometimes we bottle them up, sometimes we let them explode.  Finding that sweet spot of expressing them in a way that feels right for you and for others is a journey.  It's like learning a new language, the language of feelings! \ud83d\ude09 And it's totally learnable.\n\nAbout letting go of things \u2013 you said nothing.  Wow, that's interesting!  Sometimes we hold onto things without even realizing it \u2013 old beliefs, maybe some past hurts, or even just old habits.  Maybe think of it like this:  if you were spring cleaning your mind, is there any little corner that could use a bit of decluttering?  Just a thought! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nAnd pomegranate as a vegetable... haha!  That's a fun answer!  You've got a playful side, I see!  Maybe you were thinking outside the box there, which is super cool.  Thinking differently is a real strength! \u2728\n\nSaying you've never failed anyone you loved or loved you...  You know, being human is kind of messy sometimes, right?  We all make mistakes and unintentionally let people down.  It's part of being in relationships.  Maybe thinking about times you felt you *could* have done better, even in small ways, could be a way to learn and grow, not to beat yourself up, okay?  Growth, not guilt! \ud83d\ude09\n\nAnd \"perfect world\" being right now \u2013 that's a really positive way to look at things!  That shows you're able to find contentment and happiness in the present moment, which is a real gift.  Tell me more about what makes it feel perfect for you? \ud83d\ude0a\n\nAbout being seen as \"selfish\" for focusing on your goals \u2013 lots of driven people get that label!  It sounds like you're ambitious and know what you want, which is awesome.  Sometimes, setting boundaries and prioritizing yourself can look like \"selfishness\" to others, but it's actually just healthy self-care.  As long as you're not stepping on others to get ahead, you're probably just being focused and determined.  And your brain being your favorite thing about yourself?  Love it!  Brains are amazing!  \ud83e\udde0\n\n\"asdfghjk\" for favorite condiment... haha!  You're keeping me on my toes!  Maybe you're someone who likes to keep things a little mysterious, or maybe you just couldn't pick one!  Either way, it's a fun answer! \ud83d\ude04\n\n**In short, you seem like a strong person with a good foundation and a clear drive.  Areas for potential growth could be exploring your feelings a bit more, and maybe gently reflecting on substance use and past experiences.  But overall, you're doing great! Keep up the awesome work!**  \ud83d\udc4d\n\nWant to crack a joke to lighten things up?  Why don't scientists trust atoms?  Because they make up everything! \ud83d\ude02  Get it?  Make up... everything!  Okay, okay, maybe I need to work on my jokes. \ud83d\ude09\n\nHow are you feeling after our little chat?  Anything else on your mind?  And seriously, what *is* your favorite condiment?  You've got me curious now! \ud83d\ude04"

            "wellness_report": "Hey there! \ud83d\udc4b  Thanks for sharing your answers with me.  It takes courage to look at these things, and you've done great!  Let's chat about what your answers suggest, okay?  Think of me as your friendly guide in all this. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nSo, looking at your answers, it seems like you're someone who's got a good foundation.  It's awesome that you feel you have a strong support system \u2013 that's like having a superpower in life!  And really good news that you're not having thoughts of harming yourself or struggling with flashbacks.  That shows a good level of stability, which is fantastic! \ud83d\udc4d\n\nNow, let's just gently touch on a couple of things, okay?  You mentioned substance use.  It's super common, and lots of people use substances for different reasons.  Maybe it would be helpful to think a little bit about how it's fitting into your life, and if it's helping you feel the way you want to feel.  No judgment at all here, just something to maybe reflect on. \ud83e\udd14\n\nAlso, you said expressing feelings openly is a bit of a challenge right now.  Hey, emotions can be tricky for everyone!  Sometimes we bottle them up, sometimes we let them explode.  Finding that sweet spot of expressing them in a way that feels right for you and for others is a journey.  It's like learning a new language, the language of feelings! \ud83d\ude09 And it's totally learnable.\n\nAbout letting go of things \u2013 you said nothing.  Wow, that's interesting!  Sometimes we hold onto things without even realizing it \u2013 old beliefs, maybe some past hurts, or even just old habits.  Maybe think of it like this:  if you were spring cleaning your mind, is there any little corner that could use a bit of decluttering?  Just a thought! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nAnd pomegranate as a vegetable... haha!  That's a fun answer!  You've got a playful side, I see!  Maybe you were thinking outside the box there, which is super cool.  Thinking differently is a real strength! \u2728\n\nSaying you've never failed anyone you loved or loved you...  You know, being human is kind of messy sometimes, right?  We all make mistakes and unintentionally let people down.  It's part of being in relationships.  Maybe thinking about times you felt you *could* have done better, even in small ways, could be a way to learn and grow, not to beat yourself up, okay?  Growth, not guilt! \ud83d\ude09\n\nAnd \"perfect world\" being right now \u2013 that's a really positive way to look at things!  That shows you're able to find contentment and happiness in the present moment, which is a real gift.  Tell me more about what makes it feel perfect for you? \ud83d\ude0a\n\nAbout being seen as \"selfish\" for focusing on your goals \u2013 lots of driven people get that label!  It sounds like you're ambitious and know what you want, which is awesome.  Sometimes, setting boundaries and prioritizing yourself can look like \"selfishness\" to others, but it's actually just healthy self-care.  As long as you're not stepping on others to get ahead, you're probably just being focused and determined.  And your brain being your favorite thing about yourself?  Love it!  Brains are amazing!  \ud83e\udde0\n\n\"asdfghjk\" for favorite condiment... haha!  You're keeping me on my toes!  Maybe you're someone who likes to keep things a little mysterious, or maybe you just couldn't pick one!  Either way, it's a fun answer! \ud83d\ude04\n\n**In short, you seem like a strong person with a good foundation and a clear drive.  Areas for potential growth could be exploring your feelings a bit more, and maybe gently reflecting on substance use and past experiences.  But overall, you're doing great! Keep up the awesome work!**  \ud83d\udc4d\n\nWant to crack a joke to lighten things up?  Why don't scientists trust atoms?  Because they make up everything! \ud83d\ude02  Get it?  Make up... everything!  Okay, okay, maybe I need to work on my jokes. \ud83d\ude09\n\nHow are you feeling after our little chat?  Anything else on your mind?  And seriously, what *is* your favorite condiment?  You've got me curious now! \ud83d\ude04"
