    "wellness_report": "Okay, friend, Chikitsa here again!  It's great you're checking in with yourself again using these questions.  This consistency is actually really helpful because it shows us a clearer picture of what's going on. Let's look at your responses in summary, like we're reviewing notes as professional psychiatrists, okay?\n\nSo, reviewing your answers across these assessments, a consistent pattern emerges, and that's actually very informative.  It's like we're seeing the same themes come up again and again, which tells us these are important areas for you right now.\n\n**On the positive side (your strengths, consistently shining through):**\n\n* **You maintain a baseline of self-esteem:**  The \"Yes\" to feeling good about yourself sometimes is a really important anchor. It shows you have a positive core self-perception to build upon, even when things are tough.\n* **You are future-focused:**  \"What's next?\" as a book title consistently highlights your forward-thinking nature and a sense of anticipation for what's ahead in life. This is a great source of motivation and resilience.\n* **You are outwardly kind and considerate:**  The \"Yes, every time\" to making others happy is a beautiful and consistent trait.  It speaks to your empathy and desire to create positive experiences for those around you.\n* **You demonstrate resilience and coping mechanisms:** The \"summer mood\" analogy consistently shows your ability to handle pressure and \"let things go.\" Your anger management strategies are consistently mature and thoughtful.\n* **You have problem-solving abilities:**  Your acknowledgement of your problem-solving skills, even with the efficiency caveat, is consistently present.  This indicates a strength in analytical thinking and tackling challenges.\n* **You value positive experiences and connection:**  Your memories of childhood games and recent laughter with friends consistently point to your appreciation for joy, playfulness, and social connections.\n* **You are ambitious and goal-oriented:** The 10-digit retirement goal consistently demonstrates your drive and ambition for financial success.\n\n**Areas indicating potential challenges (consistent themes requiring attention):**\n\n* **Persistent feelings of overwhelm and stress:**  The consistent \"Yes\" to feeling overwhelmed and stressed by recent events is a significant indicator. This suggests an ongoing experience of pressure and difficulty managing current life circumstances.\n* **Lack of healthy and supportive relationships:**  The consistent \"No\" to healthy and supportive relationships remains a critical area.  This points to a potential lack of social and emotional support which can significantly impact mental well-being.\n* **Recurring feelings of inadequacy and worthlessness:** The consistent \"Yes\" to these feelings, while fluctuating alongside feeling good about yourself sometimes, suggests an underlying vulnerability in self-worth that is triggered by certain situations or events.\n* **Ongoing sleep and eating difficulties:** The consistent \"Yes\" to difficulty sleeping and eating is a strong physical manifestation of the stress and emotional distress you are experiencing.  This is a key symptom to address for overall well-being.\n\n**In summary, from a professional perspective:**\n\nYour repeated responses paint a picture of someone who possesses significant inner strengths, resilience, and positive qualities.  You have a foundation of self-esteem, a forward-looking perspective, and a genuine desire to bring happiness to others.  However, you are consistently experiencing significant stress, a lack of supportive relationships, and recurring negative self-perceptions which are impacting your sleep and appetite.\n\nThe consistency of these answers reinforces the importance of addressing the areas of stress and relationship support.  These are not fleeting feelings, but rather ongoing experiences that are impacting your overall well-being.\n\n**Moving forward:**\n\nSince we are seeing these patterns consistently, perhaps we can now start to explore the *sources* of your stress and the *nature* of the support you feel you are lacking in relationships.  Understanding these deeper aspects will be key to developing strategies to help you feel more balanced and supported.\n\nWhat do you think?  Are you open to talking more about what might be contributing to your stress and the kind of relationships you wish you had?  Remember, Chikitsa is here to listen and help you navigate this, step by step."
