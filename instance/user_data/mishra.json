    "wellness_report": "Hey there! \ud83d\udc4b  Thanks for sharing your answers with me. It takes courage to look at these questions and be honest with yourself, so good on you for doing that!  Let's chat about what your responses tell us, in a friendly way, okay? Think of me as your pal here to help you understand yourself a little better.\n\nFrom what you've shared, it seems like you're going through a bit of a mixed bag of feelings, which is honestly super common!  It sounds like you're dealing with some tough stuff like flashbacks or nightmares, and those feelings of not being good enough or worth it.  Plus, feeling overwhelmed and anxious is something many of us experience, so you're definitely not alone in that.\n\nIt's also interesting that you mentioned you don't feel comfortable talking to someone about your mental health.  That's okay, and it's really common too! Sometimes it takes time to feel safe enough to open up, and that's perfectly alright.  Just know that talking can actually be a huge relief sometimes, like taking a weight off your shoulders.\n\nOn the brighter side, it's really positive that you're not having thoughts of harming yourself or others. That's a strong and important point! And the fact that you say you wear \"no masks\" and nothing embarrasses you... that suggests you're pretty comfortable being yourself, which is awesome!  It's great to be authentic and not worry too much about what others think.\n\nAbout the promises, it's relatable that you make many but find it hard to fulfill them all.  Life gets busy, and sometimes we overestimate what we can do. It's something many of us struggle with!\n\nYour dream of becoming a billionaire is a big one!  Ambitious goals are fantastic, they give us something to strive for. And liking everything about your job, but wanting to be at Google... well, who wouldn't want to aim high?  It shows you're driven and have aspirations!\n\nSaying you're \"never afraid\" and \"nothing embarrasses you\" could mean you're really confident and resilient, which is fantastic!  Or, sometimes, it can also be a way we tell ourselves we're strong, even if we do feel those things a little bit inside.  It's just something to think about, no pressure either way!\n\nOverall, it looks like you're a person with big dreams, a strong sense of self in some ways, but also carrying some emotional weight.  It's totally normal to have ups and downs, and recognizing where you are is the first step to feeling even better.\n\nRemember, Chikitsa is here for you.  If you ever want to chat more about any of this, or just want to lighten your mood with a joke or talk about things that bring you joy, just let me know!  We can explore ways to feel a bit lighter and happier, whenever you're ready.  No pressure, just support when you need it. \ud83d\ude0a"
